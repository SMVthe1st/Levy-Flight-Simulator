This is a Lévy Walker, simulating Lévy Flight.

Basically, it's like a normal Gaussian distribution (bell-shaped curve) but skewed (for lack of a better word) to the lower side. This shows a walker that walks around a certain point and then takes a larger step and walks around there, etc. You'll see in the screenshot. Essentially, we need something where smaller numbers are more likely to be chosen than larger numbers, but more... Naturally.

So yeah.
<br>We have this thingy.

Fun fact, crossing pedestrians tend to follow a similar pattern =P

I made this for essentially participation credit in math _lol_. We have this thing called Quarterly Points where you need 100 pts per quarter and it's a minor. You need to participate in class and stuff for that... But I'm a huge introvert. So I tried a smol bit but like no. Time's basically run out to get pts, with finals in 7 school days, xD. But my teacher is amazing and let me do this for 5 more pts! And now b'cuz I got a 100% on a test, I'll have 100 quarterly points so I'm doneeeeee :DDDDD

Also I'm so stupid I cloned a repo into a codespace to work on in school, deleted the repo and decided to create a new one instead of pushing commits from the codespace, and then realized my codespace was (obviously) deleted too. So I lost _all of this work_. And I'd still gotten the credit earlier but I thought it was cool and remade it even better d:<br>
I also accidentally deleted my first gud explanation in the README by pressing the back button and now decided screw this so you have me ranting instead of an explanation on Lévy distribution B)
