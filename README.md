This is a Lévy Walker, simulating Lévy Flight.

Basically, it's like a normal Gaussian distribution (bell-shaped curve) but skewed (for lack of a better word) to the lower side. This shows a walker that walks around a certain point and then takes a larger step and walks around there, etc. You'll see in the screenshot. Essentially, we need something where smaller numbers are more likely to be chosen than larger numbers, but more... Naturally.

So yeah.
<br>We have this thingy.

Fun fact, crossing pedestrians tend to follow a similar pattern =P
